/**
 * Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices 
 * as a list, where: 	
 * 		- The indices are the time in minutes past trade 
 * 		  opening time, which was 9:30am local time. 
 * 		- The values are the price in dollars of Apple 
 * 		  stock at that time. 
 * So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, 
 * stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500. 
 * 
 * Write an efficient function that takes 
 * stock_prices_yesterday and returns the 
 * best profit I could have made from 1 purchase 
 * and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.
 * 
 * No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not 
 * buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).
